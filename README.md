X Cooldown Engagement is a Microsoft Edge (Chromium) extension that enforces intentional friction on X interactions. Engagement actions require a short reflection and timed cooldown before unlocking. Cooldowns escalate with repeated attempts and persist across sessions, while allowing normal viewing and navigation.
